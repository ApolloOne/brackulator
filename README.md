#Brackets-Brackulator

Although it's ready to use, it's still considered a work in progress. Feel free to jump in, if you think you can contribute!

CTRL-F1 will show the calculator in the bottom left of the brackets window, pressing CTRL-F1 again will hide it. It is also available in the View menu as 'Open brackulator'

On the calculator result pane:
- left mouse button double click : will clear the calculator ( like 'C' )
- right mouse button click : will copy the result to the clipboard
- right mouse button click + shift : will insert the result on the current cursor position in the editor.
